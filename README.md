### **ðŸš€ LangChain & Agentic Framework Cheat Sheet**  

#### **ðŸ”¹ Agents**  
- **What?** A system that decides what actions to take dynamically.  
- **With LLM:** Uses AI to understand input and select the right tools.  
- **Without LLM:** Uses rule-based logic or predefined workflows.  
- **Why?** Reduces manual logic and makes workflows more flexible.  

#### **ðŸ”¹ Tools**  
- **What?** Functions wrapped inside LangChain that agents can call.  
- **Why?** Modular, reusable, and dynamically selectable.  
- **Examples:** Fetching API data, generating synthetic data, calling external services.  

#### **ðŸ”¹ LangChain**  
- **What?** A framework to build AI-powered applications using agents & tools.  
- **Why?** Helps integrate LLMs, manage workflows, and automate decision-making.  
- **Use Cases:** AI chatbots, automation scripts, data processing pipelines.  

#### **ðŸ”¹ LangGraph**  
- **What?** A framework for complex, multi-step workflows.  
- **Why?** Supports parallel execution, branching, and decision trees.  
- **Use Cases:** Data validation, multi-step API calls, complex automation.  

#### **âš¡ When to Use What?**  
âœ… **Use an agent** if tasks need dynamic execution & tool selection.  
âœ… **Use tools** to modularize logic & make functions reusable.  
âœ… **Use LangChain** when integrating AI for decision-making.  
âœ… **Use LangGraph** for complex workflows with multiple steps.  

ðŸš€ **Key takeaway:** If your current workflow is **fixed and predictable**, a normal script works fine. If you need **dynamic execution, AI decision-making, or complex workflows**, agentic frameworks help!
